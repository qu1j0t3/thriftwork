This will be an implementation of the client and server for the SimonSays service
described in this Facebook puzzle: http://www.facebook.com/careers/puzzles.php?puzzle_id=13

Since the puzzle server is down, I decided to try to implement the server side as well.

'make run-server' should build and run the 'simple' (non-ssl) server.

Requires:
 - thrift source code distribution, http://thrift.apache.org/download/
 - Simple Logging Facade for Java, http://www.slf4j.org/download.html
